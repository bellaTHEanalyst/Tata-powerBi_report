## Introduction
Hi, I'm **Isabella**. I'm happy to share some insights about your business. Thank you for providing the guiding questions. It was helpful to see what types of insights you are looking to gain from the data. I hope you find the analysis compelling and helpful as you make decisions regarding future business opportunities.
First, I want to assure you that I have provided the most up-to-date and error-free analysis. After loading the data into my software, I removed any records that had negative quantities or unit prices. These records need to be removed in order to provide helpful analysis.

### The analysis focused on the following areas:
- Sales trends

 - Customer demographics

- Product profitability

-  Marketing effectiveness

  # TASK
  
 ## Background information on the task

 An online retail store has hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyze what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
 
The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and I need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to decide on expansion.
